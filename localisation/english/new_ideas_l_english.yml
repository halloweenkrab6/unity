NAU_decadence:0 "The Decadent Peace"
NAU_decadence_desc:0 "Decades of peace have reigned ever since the repeated signing of the Paris Peace Accords- it has been years since the North American Union has seen war, and the might of our war machine has slipped, unrefined and uncalibrated. With the prospect of conflict on the horizon, the NAU may yet wake from the comforting embrace of it's decadent peace."

ROC_meatgrinder_0_desc:0 "In previous engagements against the Russians and Japanese, the forces we have mobilized have suffered extremely high casualty rates as a result of lengthy campaigns to defend our homeland. Our officer corps is lacking in experienced members, and our military administration remains reluctant to adopt new stratagems to prevent this trend from continuing."

ROC_meatgrinder_2:0 "Bai-Mang-Huo"

ROC_meatgrinder_3_desc:0 "The formation of shock brigades trained in deep infiltration tactics and completely dedicated to the Chinese cause has bolstered our armed forces and cut down on the sharp casualties caused by our counteroffensives.

ROC_zhang_econ_0:0 "Paigist Economic Reform"
ROC_zhang_econ_0_desc:0 "The beginning of Paigist economic reform has been difficult in China, in part due to the vast destructing wrought from the foreigners' march on Nanjing, and the difficulty of calibrating our economy along corporatist lines. While some growth has been seen, the large amounts of political capital invested in these measures have hampered our overall economic growth."

ROC_stay_behind:0 "Stay-Behind Cells"
ROC_stay_behind_desc:0 "The next war with Japan is all anyone can think about. Under Zhang's doctrine, we have organized several stay-behind cells to coordinate our forces trapped behind the frontline and sow chaos in territories occupied by the Japanese."

ROC_creeping_barrage_upgrade:0 "Unending Barrage"
ROC_creeping_barrage_upgrade_desc:0 "Flexible provisions and positioning, alongside increased developments in theory, have made our long guns much more versatile. Trained and prepared to support multiple operations at once through interlocking lines of fire, we can rapidly change the concentration and timing of our barrages to hit opponents suddenly and without warning."
